# For the casino owner that plays many games, the expected reward can be determined once again using a steady-state analysis
# and 95% confidence interval, as performed in question 1. The only difference in this scenario is that monetary gains are calculalated
# instead of monetary losses. Therefore, the expected rewards for this game from the perspective of the casino owner is the inverse of the
# answer from question 1, or [31.79297649475803, 20.007023505241968]
